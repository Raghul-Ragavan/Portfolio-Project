# Portfolio-Project

Raghul Ragavan Pandiarajan  

For the design I have went with a single page Landing along with minimal texts and images. For the typography I have used Rosso one and poppin 
from google fonts and imported in css. For the colors in design I obtained a palette from a vector i converted from a potrait image of myself. I have 
managed to contrast of the design throughout the design by alternating bright and dark section.

For the accessability , all images have been given alt text for easy accessability and also aria-labels are provided for all the buttons links and input 
field for screen reader to pick up for the accessability.

For search engine optimisation , a brief description of the website and portfolio were provided. In addition relavant words of portfolio were used all 
over the website. A meta tag with most search portfolio keywords were also picked and used in the header to rank top in the search engine.
